# Animal-Shelter-Database-Management-Application

## About the Project/Project Title
This application helps the user access and search a database of the animals at CS 340 Austin Animal Center (AAC). The user would ask Grazioso Salvare, the project requester, to create a dashboard and use it to search for animals using a filter. This project also gives the user access to charts, user interaction, and geolocation mapping for locating and using animals for search and rescue.

## Motivation
This project aims to give Python applications a reusable and effective means of interacting with MongoDB databases. By encapsulating CRUD operations within a Python class, developers can quickly incorporate MongoDB functionality into their projects without writing repetitive database interaction code.

## Tools
*	Python
*	MongoDB

## Why Python and MongoDB?
*	Python:
    *	Simplicity: Python's straightforward syntax and readability make it ideal for rapid development and maintenance.
    *	Rich Ecosystem: Python offers extensive libraries and frameworks for various tasks, facilitating seamless integration with other tools.
    *	Community Support: Python has a large and active community that provides resources, tutorials, and packages.
*	MongoDB:
    *	Flexible Data Model: MongoDB's document-based approach allows for easy handling of unstructured data, which is beneficial for managing diverse animal records.
    *	Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, accommodating growing data needs.
    *	Python Integration (pymongo): MongoDB's official Python driver (pymongo) provides a Pythonic interface for interacting with MongoDB, simplifying database operations.

## Motivation for Using Dash
Dash, the tool used to build the dashboard, was desirable due to its dynamic nature. Dash is a react JavaScript-based tool that provides an incredibly responsive framework. Dash involves HTML Dash tags that control outputs to segments. Then, updates to any of the target inputs specified in the app callbacks process are made based on instructions programmed in the Python module.

### Create Method
* Description: Adds a document to the designated MongoDB collection and database.
*	Input: Accepts a set of key-value pairs that are compatible with the insert API call of the MongoDB driver.
*	Return: If the insert operation is successful, it returns True; if not, it returns False

### Read Method
* Description: Requests documents from the designated MongoDB collection and database.
* Input: Takes key/value lookup pairs for use with the find API call for the MongoDB driver.
* Return: If the query is successful, MongoDB returns an empty list; otherwise, it returns a cursor containing the results.
![Read Method](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27d68993-615f-4653-b145-02b54cc783f9)

### Update Method
* Description: Searches and modifies documents within the designated MongoDB collection and database.
* Return: If successful, return the updated document in JSON format; if not, return an error message.

### Delete Method
* Description: Searches and deletes documents from the designated MongoDB collection and database.
* Input: Accepts key/value lookup pairs for use with the find API call for the MongoDB driver.
* Return: If successful, MongoDB returns the outcome in JSON format; if not, it returns an error message.

### Challenges Encountered
* Data Import: Guaranteeing the integrity and correct formatting of imported data.
* User Authentication: Setting up MongoDB to safely require user authentication.
* Geolocation updates: The geolocation map didnâ€™t update when switching filters.  Index selected rows by column names instead of indices
